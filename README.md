# Data_Visualization_Crime_Analytics
Data Visualization: Crime_Analytics

In this assignment we study the crime incident data set for the city of Seattle in the summer of 2014. Two types of questions are studied and answered. First, we study the temporal patterns of the incidents, i.e. we answered "How do incidents vary by time of day and month to month?" Second, we study the geographical pattern of the crime incidents. Specifically, we answered "How do incidents vary by neighborhood?"
